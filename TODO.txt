Things to do in the future:
- write EXAMPLE.md
- Implement support for Windows platform
- Remake CMake configuration file to be professional and cross-platform

Optional things that would enchance the engine:
- Invent new way of drawing texture on a column, add one-sdl-call based opacity shading
- Code tools for wider control over what is rendered for engine users
